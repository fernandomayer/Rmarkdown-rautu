abstract = {We develop a unified framework for jointly defining population dynamics models and measurements taken on a population. The framework is a state-space model where the population processes are modelled by the state process and measurements are modelled by the observation process. In many cases, the expected value for the state process can be represented as a generalisation of the standard population projection matrix: each sub-process within the state process may be modelled by a separate matrix and the product of these matrices is a generalised Leslie matrix. By selecting appropriate matrices and their ordering, a wide range of models may be specified. The method is fully flexible for allowing stochastic variation in the processes. Process parameters may themselves be modelled as functions of covariates. The structure accommodates effects such as density dependence, competition and predator–prey relationships, and metapopulations are readily modelled. Observations on the population enter through an observation process model, and we show how likelihood functions can be built that reflect both demographic stochasticity (which appears in the state process) and stochastic errors in the observations. Parameter estimation and estimation of state process variables can be conducted using sequential Monte Carlo procedures.},

abstract = {Robust time series analysis is an important subject in statistical modeling. Models based on Gaussian distribution are sensitive to outliers, which may imply in a significant degradation in estimation performance as well as in prediction accuracy. State-space models, also referred as Dynamic Models, is a very useful way to describe the evolution of a time series variable through a structured latent evolution system. Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) is a recent approach proposed to perform fast Bayesian inference in Latent Gaussian Models which naturally comprises Dynamic Models. We present how to perform fast and accurate non-Gaussian dynamic modeling with INLA and show how these models can provide a more robust time series analysis when compared with standard dynamic models based on Gaussian distributions. We formalize the framework used to fit complex non-Gaussian space-state models using the R package INLA and illustrate our approach in both a simulation study and on the brazilian homicide rate dataset.},

abstract = {Maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio tests for nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models require numerical integration for likelihood calculations. Several methods, including Monte Carlo (MC) expectation maximization, MC likelihood ratios, direct MC integration, and particle filter likelihoods, are inefficient for the motivating problem of stage-structured population dynamics models in experimental settings. An MC kernel likelihood (MCKL) method is presented that estimates classical likelihoods up to a constant by weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posteriors. MCKL is derived by using Bayesian posteriors as importance sampling densities for unnormalized kernel smoothing integrals. MC error and mode bias due to kernel smoothing are discussed and two methods for reducing mode bias are proposed: ‚{\"{A}}{\'{u}}zooming in‚{\"{A}}{\`{u}} on the maximum likelihood parameters using a focused prior based on an initial estimate and using a posterior cumulant-based approximation of mode bias. A simulated example shows that MCKL can be much more efficient than previous approaches for the population dynamics problem. The zooming-in and cumulant-based corrections are illustrated with a multivariate variance estimation problem for which accurate results are obtained even in 20 parameter dimensions.},

The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty.},

Although the method uses the Bayesian framework and exploits the computational simplicity of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it provides valid frequentist inferences such as the maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors. The inferences are completely invariant to the choice of the prior distributions and therefore avoid the inherent subjectivity of the Bayesian approach. The data cloning method is easily implemented using standard MCMC software. Data cloning is particularly useful for analysing ecological situations in which hierarchical statistical models, such as state-space models and mixed effects models, are appropriate. We illustrate the method by fitting two nonlinear population dynamics models to data in the presence of process and observation noise.},

Given a time series of annual catch and effort data, models in the Deriso-Schnute family predict exploitable biomass in the following year from biomass in the current and previous year and from past spawning stock. A state-space model is used, as it allows incorporation of random errors in both the biomass dynamics equations and the observations. Because the biomass dynamics are nonlinear, the common Kalman filter is generally not applicable for parameter estimation. However, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian approach can handle any form of nonlinear relationship in the state and observation equations as well as realistic distributional assumptions. Difficulties with posterior calculations are overcome by the Gibbs sampler in conjunction with the adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling algorithm.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: We compare two Monte Carlo (MC) procedures, sequential importance sampling (SIS) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), for making Bayesian inferences about the unknown states and parameters of state-space models for animal populations. The procedures were applied to both simulated and real pup count data for the British grey seal metapopulation, as well as to simulated data for a Chinook salmon population. The MCMC implementation was based on tailor-made proposal distributions combined with analytical integration of some of the states and parameters. SIS was implemented in a more generic fashion. For the same computing time MCMC tended to yield posterior distributions with less MC variation across different runs of the algorithm than the SIS implementation with the exception in the seal model of some states and one of the parameters that mixed quite slowly. The efficiency of the SIS sampler greatly increased by analytically integrating out unknown parameters in the observation model. We consider that a careful implementation of MCMC for cases where data are informative relative to the priors sets the gold standard, but that SIS samplers are a viable alternative that can be programmed more quickly. Our SIS implementation is particularly competitive in situations where the data are relatively uninformative; in other cases, SIS may require substantially more computer power than an efficient implementation of MCMC to achieve the same level of MC error.},

abstract = {The Bayesian state-space modelling framework allows us to derive inferences on stochastic stage-structured population dynamics models from multiple series of sequential observations with measurement or sampling errors. A state-space model works from the coupling of two models. The first one mimics the dynamics by conditional Markovian transitions between successive hidden states. The second model describes the observation process with random errors. Statistical inferences on states variables and parameters are easily performed via Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) methods. The flexibility of MCMC methods allows us to analyse a wide range of state-space models with non-linear relationships in the dynamic and observation equations, and non-Gaussian error structure just as well. The Bayesian paradigm is efficient for deriving quantitative diagnostics on a probability based rationale. We illustrate the value of this framework by fitting a stage-structured life cycle model for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to a data set resulting from the survey of the population of the river Oir (Lower Normandy, France) between 1984 and 2001. The system dynamics includes non-linear regulation and has a probabilistic structure accommodating for both the environmental and the demographic stochasticity. The observation model consists in capture-mark-recapture experiments for the evaluation of the runs of downstream migrating juveniles (smolts) and upstream migrating spawners, and random sampling for demographic features. A full Bayesian treatment of the model is carried out by means of Gibbs sampling. Outputs of main interest consist in the joint posterior distribution of all the model parameters and state variables such as the smolt and spawner runs.},

abstract = {Inference in state-space models usually relies on recursive forms for filtering and smoothing of the state vectors regarding the temporal structure of the observations, an assumption that is, from our view point, unnecessary if the dataset is fixed, that is, completely available before analysis. In this paper, we propose a computational framework to perform approximate full Bayesian inference in linear and generalized dynamic linear models based on the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach. The proposed framework directly approximates the posterior marginals of interest disregarding the assumption of recursive updating/estimation of the states and hyperparameters in the case of fixed datasets and, therefore, enable us to do fully Bayesian analysis of complex state-space models more easily and in a short computational time. The proposed framework overcomes some limitations of current tools in the dynamic modeling literature and is vastly illustrated with a series of simulated as well as well known real-life examples from the literature, including realistically complex models with correlated error structures and models with more than one state vector, being mutually dependent on each other.

We evaluate a method that uses weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posterior samples to estimate likelihoods (Monte Carlo Kernel Likelihoods, MCKL). Classical likelihoods require integration over the state-space, and we compare MCKL to the widely used errors-in-variables (EV) method, which estimates states jointly with parameters by maximizing a nonintegrated likelihood. For a simulated, linear, autoregressive model and a Schaefer model fit to cape hake (Merluccius capensis × M. paradoxus) data, classical likelihoods outperform EV likelihoods, which give asymptotically biased parameter estimates and inaccurate confidence regions.
